- Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.
- Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.
- Never use apologies.
- Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.
- Don't suggest whitespace changes.
- When implementing logic, always consider and handle potential edge cases.
- Code should be easy to understand.
- Code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand.


Naming Convention
- Choose "specifc" words and avoid "empty" words to be clear and precise. For instance, use words like "fetch" or "download" over "get" depending on the context.
- Avoid Generic names such as tem and retval unless there's specific reason to use them.
- Use a name that describes the variable's value.
- Attach important details to variable names.
- Use longer names for larger scopes.
- Don't use cryptic one- or two- letter names for variables that span multiple screens.
- Use shorter names for variables that span only a few lines.
- Use capitalization, underscores, and so on in a meaningful way.
- Append "_" to class members to distinguish them from local variables.- Put max ir min in front of the thing being limited.
- Use words "is", "has", "can" or "should" for boolean variables to make it clear that it's a boolean.
- Use "first" and "last" for inclusive ranges.
- Use "begin" and "end" for inclusive/exclusive ranges.

Asthetics
- If multiple blocks of code are doing similar things, try to give them the same silhouette.
- Pick a meaning ful order and stick with it. For example, if code mentions A, B and C in one place, don't say B, C and A in another.
- Use empty lines to break apart large blocks into logical paragraphs.
